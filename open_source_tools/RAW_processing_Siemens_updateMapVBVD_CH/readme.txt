This folder contains code related to RAW data processing.


Please make sure that any code you commit to the repository is well documented!


Code related to certain pre- or postprocessing procedures should be stored in corresponding subfolders


For MATLAB functions please also add comments about the usage at the beginning of the file which can be
accessed using the MATLAB help function. An example how such a function could look like can be found in
extractHeader.m


PLEASE DO NOT COMMIT LARGE FILES LIKE RAW DATA FILES TO THE REPOSITORY UNLESS EXPLICITLY NEEDED! Doing
so will cause a lot of data traffic and unnecessary waste of harddrive space for all the users that
check out the repository but don't need these files.Rather store large files on the workgroup server
and link them in your code if necessary.


Please do not add unneeded files like MATLAB autosaves (.asv) or compiled code for which sources are
available.
