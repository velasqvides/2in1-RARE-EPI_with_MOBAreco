# RelaxationColorMap: acts in two ways:
#   1. generate a colormap to be used on display, given image type 
#      (which must be one of 
#       "T1","R1","T2","T2*","R2","R2*","T1rho","T1ρ","R1rho","R1ρ","t1","r1","t2","t2*","r2","r2*","t1rho","t1ρ","r1rho","r1ρ")
#      and given the range of the image to be displayed;
#   2. generates a 'clipped' image, which is a copy of the input image except that values are clipped to the lower level,
#      while respecting the special value of 0 (which has to map to the "invalid" color)
#   Arguments:
#       maptype: a string from aformentioned series, e.g. "T1"  or "R2"
#       x:       the image to be displayed
#       loLev       lower level of the range to be displayed
#       upLev       upper level of the range to be displayed
#   Returns:  
#       value-clipped image
#       colormap to be used in image-display functions (in Colors.RGB format)
